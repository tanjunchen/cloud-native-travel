Filters, Filters, Filters  (the filter chain and demos of filter examples) 

See the example filter: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-filter-example
If using VSCode, consider copying envoy's dev-container configuration, to have an easy start:
https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/master/.devcontainer

Use `bazel build //:envoy` to build envoy from the exmaple filter repo.
